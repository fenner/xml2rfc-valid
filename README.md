# xml2rfc-valid

This service attempts to give useful error messages
when validating a document against the rfc2629 dtd.
Sometimes an xml parser reports confusing messages
when run against an invalid document, and this
service is attempting to be more useful.

## Current state of this repo

This is simply a splat of what's running on
www.fenron.com, with hardcoded paths, ancient
perl use, etc.  The intent is to make the code
available for people to improve.
