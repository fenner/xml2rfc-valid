<h1>xml2rfc validator</h1>
<p>This validator does up to 4 passes on the uploaded XML document:
<ol>
<li>Preprocessing:
 <ol>
 <li>Change references to the DTD to point to my local copy.
 <li>Change parameter entity references (which only belong in DTDs themselves)
into general entity references (the right way to include references if
you're not using &lt;?rfc include=''?&gt; by removing the '%' after 'ENTITY'.
 </ol>
<li>Expand &lt;?rfc include=''?&gt; processing instructions, if present.
Note that this step can change line numbers by reformatting the XML.
<li>Check, using xmllint, against the RFC2629(bis) DTD (currently using the
DTD released with xml2rfc 1.32, January 7, 2007).  This checks both that the
XML is well-formed and that it matches the DTD.
Any external entities are loaded during this phase.
<li>Check, using a <a href="additional-checks.txt">funky xsl transform</a>,
additional issues that just checking against the DTD can't, e.g.,
<ul>
<li>Require anchors on references if using symrefs or sortrefs PIs
<li>Warn that figure inside t is deprecated
<li>Long titles need short abbrev attributes
<li>No duplicate anchors
<li>FYI on unreferenced anchors (error when it's a reference)
<li>FYI when plain text contains something that looks like an anchor
(e.g., &lt;t>this is seen in [RFC2822]&lt;/t>)
<li>Warn about multiple &lt;city>, &lt;region>, &lt;code> or &lt;country>
<li>Note that "Internet Draft" or "I-D" in seriesInfo should be "Internet-Draft"
<li>Require ipr or number on &lt;rfc&gt; element unless &lt;?rfc private?&gt;
<li>Warn that iprExtract is meaningless unless the ipr declared is restrictive
<li>Note that historic documents don't get a seriesNo
<li>Note that pre-3978 IPR will not be accepted after 6 May 2005
<li>&lt;?rfc strict="yes"?&gt; items (fyi unless the strict PI is in the document):
<ul>
<li>No more than 5 authors
<li>No references in abstract
<li>Missing abstract
</ul>
<li>Warn about references to expired, withdrawn, replaced or published Internet Drafts (if you're using the reference library via &lt;?rfc include=''&gt; or entity references).
<li>Warn about references to obsoleted RFCs (if you're using the reference library via &lt;?rfc include=''&gt; or entity references).
</ul>
